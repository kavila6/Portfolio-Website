          <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
          <p>I graduated from the University of Calgary with a Bachelor of Science in Geology. While I enjoyed studying Earth and rocks, I realized in my final year that the vast amount of data in geology intrigued me even more. I started wondering—how can we interpret complex concepts when dealing with massive datasets? This curiosity led me to explore data analysis.</p>

          <p>I took an introductory course in data science, and it instantly resonated with me. I genuinely enjoyed the learning process and saw immense potential in the field. Graduating in 2020 amidst the challenges of COVID-19 and the downturn in the oil and gas industry, I saw an opportunity to pivot into data analytics. I became more engaged by participating in data-focused hackathons, where I gained hands-on experience working with real data and collaborating with professionals. Through these events, I expanded my network, connected with like-minded individuals, and actively contributed as a volunteer for various organization such as the YYC Data Society.</p>
            
          <p>This journey led to my transition from working as an Environmental Lab Assistant to securing my first role as a Business Analyst at a startup. In 2023, I further strengthened my expertise by enrolling in SAIT’s Post-Diploma Certificate in Data Analytics, graduating with high honors. Shortly after, I landed a role as a Business Intelligence Analyst in the tech industry, where I gained real-world experience in data analysis, honing both my technical and soft skills to support business operations.</p>
            
          <p>Now, more than ever, I am eager to continue growing and developing my expertise in advanced data analytics, AI integration, and business intelligence. My goal is to leverage data-driven insights to provide well-informed, optimized, and cost-effective business solutions that drive impactful decision-making.</p>
